Hello there!

My name's Sarah - and I'm a data scientist based in northern Utah.

The work I've done in my career has always involved data, but hasn't always been data science. I've had the privilege to work with two nonprofit organizations and am now applying data science to boost our democracy at Citizen Data. 

I'm data savvy, of course, but because of my unique background I also have experience in a variety of different areas; like leadership, strategy, recruiting, and training.

I love applying my knack for data and economics to solve important and intersting questions, and I am well acquainted with a slew of coding languages and software.

Shoot me a message if you'd like to chat (or play a round in CoD, I'm always up for that)! Also, if you want to take a peek at what I've been working on, feel free to peruse my other repositories.
